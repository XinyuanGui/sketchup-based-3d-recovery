# sketchup-based-3d-recovery

This repository is mainly used to record my work in the sketchup-based 3d recovery work.<br>
My work is mainly to get 3d point coordinate on the 2d image and pass it to the sketchup part.<br>
The result can be seen in the paper "Building Reconstruction Based on Oblique Photogrammetry and SketchUp Secondary Development".<br>
