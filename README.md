# sketchup-based-3d-recovery

This repository is mainly used to record my work in the sketchup-based 3d recovery work.
My work is mainly to get 3d point coordinate on the 2d image and pass it to the sketchup part.
The result can be seen in the paper "Building Reconstruction Based on Oblique Photogrammetry and SketchUp Secondary Development".
